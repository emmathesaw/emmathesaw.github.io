                This 2D platformer was built in just two weeks as a rapid prototype. I designed the whole game around a watering can mechanic: players use water to grow vines and mushrooms to reach new areas, or use pesticide to shrink dangerous plants like Venus Flytraps. I wanted resource management to be a key part of the challenge, as players have to plan their path between refill puddles while searching the map for five flowers to complete their bouquet.

                This project is a Legend of Zelda NES remaster of the first dungeon level. In addition to the original dungeon, my partner and I created a custom level that can be toggled by pressing '4'. I primarily implemented the weapons, health and damage, authentic UI score panel, special rooms, and the collectable powerups.

                This drum machine-based music visualizer takes in a beat-based rhythm based on the MaxMSP output
                and displays hearts with an aura glow and different properties depending on the drum sound 
                (kick drum, snare drum, hi-hat symbol, and open hi-hat symbol).
                In Max, I wanted the user to also have the ability to manipulate the beat and change the tempo of the beat.
                As the tempo changes, so does the color scheme of the hearts. There is also a panning option included,
                which not only pans the audio, but the hearts follow and pan across the screen as well.

                I built this spectrum visualizer in Processing using the Sound library's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). I programmed it to capture live audio input from a microphone and break it into 512 frequency bands. I designed the display to represent each frequency as a vertical bar with a custom trace effect that highlights recent peaks, creating a dynamic motion that responds directly to the sound in the room.

                I created the first two compositions for a video game music class. Both songs were created for Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I really enjoyed the laidback, minimalistic nature of the soundtrack, so I wanted to emulate that in my pieces.
                My first piece is set in the day when the player is doing more mundane tasks around their island. Picking up sticks, fishing, walking along the beach; tasks where they are venturing to familiar places. I named this piece “Roaming”.
                My second piece is set at night when the player is outdoors admiring their surroundings, watering flowers and plants, or stargazing; anything that is peaceful and calming in the game. I named this piece “Froggy Night”.
                <br><br>
                The third piece was composed for my game, Wild Bouquet (featured above). I designed this track to complement the game's visual aesthetic and provide an immersive atmosphere for the player.
